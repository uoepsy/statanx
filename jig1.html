<h1>Getting to know your students</h1>
		    
<p>Students often feel that instructors expect a uniform/standard level of prior knowledge, overlooking the diversity of student backgrounds. This issue is particularly relevant for incoming post-graduate students, but is increasingly pertinent for undergraduates as programming skills become more common in secondary education.</p>

<p>Conducting a short survey before the course begins and sharing some results on the first day can have numerous benefits for students. Firstly, students may feel less isolated knowing their peers share similar concerns and backgrounds. This sense of community could reduce anxiety and foster a supportive atmosphere. Secondly, understanding the varied backgrounds of your students allows you to tailor your teaching methods to better meet their needs, ensuring no student is left behind due to assumed prior knowledge. </p>

<p>Additionally, survey results can provide instructors with practical examples for teaching rudimentary descriptive statistics. Using data from your class to create histograms, bar plots, or even calculate basic descriptive statistics can make the material more relatable and engaging.  </p>

<p>By getting to know the students in the classroom, instructors can create a more personalized, inclusive, and effective learning environment that benefits everyone. </p>

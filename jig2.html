<h1>Setting up your students for success</h1>

<h2 style="font-style: italic;">"Even though I find it intimidating sometimes […] it's really important for a lot of fields [...] it feels it’s important to learn"</h2><br>

<p>Students often juggle multiple classes across various departments, each with its own unique teaching methods and expectations. This diversity can leave students under-oriented to the specific learning and teaching modes of their courses, hindering their ability to engage effectively.  Therefore, it is crucial for instructors to invest time both at the start and throughout their courses to ensure students understand the broader context of their learning, and what they need to do to ensure they can effectively engage in their learning. By doing so, instructors can ensure that students feel adequately equipped to excel in their studies.</p>

<p>Instructors should set aside time to simply outline their expectations and course structure rationale to students. For example, clearly communicating what is expected of students on the course, explaining why/how the course is structured the way it is, and what the purpose of the assessment(s) is in relation to their knowledge/skills development. Equipping students with this information should make them feel like they understand why their learning experience has been designed in a particular way.</p>

<p>One-way instructors can keep students on track is by continuously making explicit links across course content and encouraging students to engage in reflection. By doing so, instructors can help students piece together the 'big picture' of their course and see how the knowledge and skills gained are applicable in real-world contexts. Instructors can pave the way for their students to succeed by engaging in active scaffolding and maintaining clear, accessible communication about learning and assessment.</p>


<button type="button" class="collapsible2">2.1 Establish clear expectations and course structure</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Invest time at the start of the course to clearly communicate your expectations, the rationale behind the course structure, and the purpose of assessments. This helps students understand the importance of each pedagogical element of the course and encourages them to see why engaging with that element is helpful.

<button type="button" class="collapsible2">2.3 Provide scaffolding and active support</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Engage in active scaffolding throughout the course, offering guidance and maintaining clear, accessible communication about learning and assessment. This can help students, especially those with diverse backgrounds, adapt to the specific teaching methods and expectations of your course, institution, and country.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible2">2.4 Foster a sense of orientation</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Set aside time for students to understand the specific learning and teaching modes of your course, as well as how it fits into their broader academic journey. This can help them engage more effectively, despite the competing demands they may face across their studies.
  </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible2">2.5 Encourage continuous reflection</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Prompt students to reflect on how the course content and skills relate to their personal and professional goals. This can enhance their motivation and investment in the learning process, potentially reducing statistics anxiety. We encourage a shift from notion-based to skills-based teaching.
  </p>
  <p>Formative quizzes at key checkpoints (e.g., middle and end of semester) can include questions that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>prompt students to reflect on their confidence in using methods learned in the course thus far in order to address research questions.</li>
    <li>get students to rank confidence in the list of topics covered so far, prompting them to reflect on where to focus their revision</li>
    <li>provide prompts for them to develop a plan for building confidence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These sort of questions have the secondary benefit of highlighting to instructors the areas of the course that are most difficult for students</p>

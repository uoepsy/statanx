<h1>Setting up your students for success</h1>

<p>Students often juggle multiple classes across various departments, each with its own unique teaching methods and expectations. This diversity can leave students under-oriented to the specific learning and teaching modes of their courses, hindering their ability to engage effectively.  Therefore, it is crucial for instructors to invest time both at the start and throughout their courses to ensure students understand the broader context of their learning, and what they need to do to ensure they can effectively engage in their learning. By doing so, instructors can ensure that students feel adequately equipped to excel in their studies.</p>

<p>Instructors should set aside time to simply outline their expectations and course structure rationale to students. For example, clearly communicating what is expected of students on the course, explaining why/how the course is structured the way it is, and what the purpose of the assessment(s) is in relation to their knowledge/skills development. Equipping students with this information should make them feel like they understand why their learning experience has been designed in a particular way.</p>

<p>One-way instructors can keep students on track is by continuously making explicit links across course content and encouraging students to engage in reflection. By doing so, instructors can help students piece together the 'big picture' of their course and see how the knowledge and skills gained are applicable in real-world contexts. Instructors can pave the way for their students to succeed by engaging in active scaffolding and maintaining clear, accessible communication about learning and assessment.</p>

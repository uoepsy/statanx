<h1>Teaching your students</h1>

<h3><i>"I found that while I do sometimes have more initial anxiety in those smaller group settings, especially with statistics, it goes away a lot better than with a lecture because I come away from the class feeling like I learned."</i></h3>
<h3><i>"You get email notifications when a new question is posted on [forum] and it's if anything, just reassuring to see that people are asking questions as well and often I'll find a question that I did not even think about asking."</i></h3>


<p>Effective teaching is essential for maintaining student engagement and encouraging academic growth. By utilizing interactive lectures/demonstrations, facilitating hands-on individual/group activities, and by providing materials that students can work through/review at their own pace, instructors can effectively capture and sustain students' attention.</p>  

<p>Relating teaching material to real-world examples and literature in the wider field may help to enhance student engagement. By illustrating how concepts apply in practical situations and connecting them to current research, instructors can make the material more meaningful and relevant.</p>  

<p>Recognizing the heterogeneity of student learning preferences, instructors should aim to provide a range of learning opportunities via varied teaching methods/materials. These could include online resources, discussion forums, diverse reading lists, and hands-on activities to cater to the majority of students. As well as engaging in different teaching methods, instructors should aim to offer varied support options (e.g., 1:1 meetings, small group sessions, or large Q&A sessions) to allow students to feel comfortable seeking help in their preferred learning environment.</p>   

<p>Creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment where students feel valued should ensure that instructors can foster a positive academic learning culture conducive to learning and growth.</p>

<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Interactive lectures and demonstrations can effectively capture and sustain students' attention, enhancing engagement and learning. Examples include flipped classroom lectures, where students watch a recording before class (or read material) and the in-person time is devoted to interactive examples, or synchronous programming demonstrations where students get to see the "hidden curriculum" of real-life coding practice.</p>

<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Hands-on activities provide opportunities for students to actively apply concepts, reinforcing their understanding. Offer students the opportunity to engage in group activities, strengthening soft skills that will be relevant in their future career as well as giving them a sense of belonging and ownership of the project.</p>

<h1>Supporting your students</h1>

<p>Student learning does not stop at the end of class, and neither does their need for support. Instructors should take a holistic approach to student support that addresses a diversity of needs, including wellbeing, academic skills, and peer support, while promoting engagement in extracurricular activities.</p> 

 
<p>Instructors need to be prepared to support their students beyond the classroom and be ready to connect or signpost them to range of wider support services. It is essential to be aware of the specialized services offered in your university and how to connect students to these. For example, students may need assistance accessing services such as the disability service (e.g., for tailored learning support, reasonable adjustments), wellbeing services (e.g., for pastoral care, mental health support), and other academic support services (e.g., study skills, proofreading services).</p>   

 
<p>Within the classroom, instructors should facilitate course-specific buddy systems to promote peer support and collaborative learning, enhancing the student learning experience and sense of belonging. To encourage networking outside the classroom, instructors should promote existing groups/communities and initiatives related to their studentsâ€™ subject area. This would allow students to learn from and collaborate with like-minded peers and professionals, and offer practical, real-world applications of the skills they have learned in the classroom.</p>  

<p>Creating and sharing open software resource lists could be very helpful to students. These lists can include links to cheat sheets, tutorials, and forums, providing students with additional learning tools. These resources can supplement core teaching materials and offer opportunities for independent study and skill development.</p>  

<p>By integrating these diverse support strategies, instructors can help create a well-rounded, supportive environment that promotes both academic success and personal wellbeing.</p>

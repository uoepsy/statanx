<h1>Supporting your students</h1>

<p>Student learning does not stop at the end of class, and neither does their need for support. Instructors should take a holistic approach to student support that addresses a diversity of needs, including wellbeing, academic skills, and peer support, while promoting engagement in extracurricular activities.</p> 

 
<p>Instructors need to be prepared to support their students beyond the classroom and be ready to connect or signpost them to range of wider support services. It is essential to be aware of the specialized services offered in your university and how to connect students to these. For example, students may need assistance accessing services such as the disability service (e.g., for tailored learning support, reasonable adjustments), wellbeing services (e.g., for pastoral care, mental health support), and other academic support services (e.g., study skills, proofreading services).</p>   

 
<p>Within the classroom, instructors should facilitate course-specific buddy systems to promote peer support and collaborative learning, enhancing the student learning experience and sense of belonging. To encourage networking outside the classroom, instructors should promote existing groups/communities and initiatives related to their students’ subject area. This would allow students to learn from and collaborate with like-minded peers and professionals, and offer practical, real-world applications of the skills they have learned in the classroom.</p>  

<p>Creating and sharing open software resource lists could be very helpful to students. These lists can include links to cheat sheets, tutorials, and forums, providing students with additional learning tools. These resources can supplement core teaching materials and offer opportunities for independent study and skill development.</p>  

<p>By integrating these diverse support strategies, instructors can help create a well-rounded, supportive environment that promotes both academic success and personal wellbeing.</p>  

  
<button type="button" class="collapsible4">4.1 End your lecture with a standard slide signposting available opportunities for support</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Instructors should acknowledge the diversity of students in the classroom. Not all support needs can be addressed during office hours. As such, we recommend having a standard slide at the end of each of your lectures signposting wider support available to students from your university.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible4">4.2 Highlight student networks or groups in the subject area</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Students highlight the need to feel a sense of belonging and of community. This can also help ensure they keep engaged with your course and their studies more generally. If a student group is available in your subject area, advertise it. Alternatively, encourage students to form peer support and discussion groups.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible4">4.3 Link students to communities outside of the University domain</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Chances are that, outside of your university, a community of data scientists organise regular meetup groups. Signpost these meetings in your course webpage or via announcement. These meetings provide an opportunity for students to network with industry professionals, learn and/or practice skills useful for their employability, and can keep them motivated and interested in your course if they see real-life applications. For example, in Edinburgh there are local R user groups (R Ladies), the Edinburgh Scientific Research community, Codebar.

<button type="button" class="collapsible4">4.4 Offer optional extra-curricular activities to develop students’ employability and skills</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>We encourage instructors to also organise extra-curricular activities to foster students’ skills and keep them motivated. Examples include tidy-Tuesday style plotting competitions, or more general hackathons around a relevant and recent topic.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible4">4.5 Software resource lists and guidance</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>If your statistics course uses programming, rather than point-and-click software, consider providing students with a “cheat sheet”. This single-page document summarising key code can help them feel supported while coding and reduce some of their anxiety that stems from coding. This way students can focus more on paying attention to the statistics concepts rather than worry about the code. To keep students motivated and interested, also consider providing a varied list of resources in your course webpage including, for example, videos, interesting articles or blogs.</p>

<h1>Assessing your students</h1>

<h2 style="font-style: italic;">"what questions are they going to ask me based on the course? Is it going to be coding related? Is it going to be statistical concepts related? Is it gonna be like mathematical equations of some sort? I feel like that for me is definitely the like biggest source of anxiety."</h2><br>


<p>Instructors can foster an assessment environment that strengthens students’ confidence and success by better integrating assessments into their learning experience. Instructors should redirect the emphasis from grades towards the process of acquiring skills and knowledge. Instructors should strive to design assessments that are personal, skills-focused, and experiential.</p> 

 
<p>Offering students agency or ownership in their assessment can mitigate anxiety and empower students to take control of their learning experience. This could be achieved by allowing choice in assessment formats, which also caters to diverse strengths and preferences, promoting engagement and ownership. An alternative option would be to incorporate group work in assessments. This would have the added benefit of fostering collaborative learning environments where students support each other and share workload responsibilities, yet be challenging in unique ways (e.g., communication, splitting work, giving feedback) – soft skills likely useful for their future careers.</p>

<p>Many students find traditional exams daunting and anxiety-inducing. Whist exams are here to stay, there are strategies instructors could use to better prepare their students.  Providing mock exams could allow students to familiarize themselves with the format and timing, reducing anxiety through practice and formative feedback. Introducing marking rubrics early on in a course could help to clarify expectations and criteria, empowering students to understand how their work will be evaluated.</p>

<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Offering students with a choice in assessment format allows students to focus on the content and concepts directly being assessed and strip away the worries about the format of the presentation of the work.

<button type="button" class="collapsible5">5.4 Offer a mock exam and practice assessments (e.g. practice quizzes)</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Implementing non-graded practice quizzes and a mock exam allows students to familiarise themselves with the format of an assessment and reduce anxiety of the unknown. This also allows students to familiarise themselves with the instructions and expectations.</p>
</div>
 

<button type="button" class="collapsible5">5.5 Allow sufficient time for assessments</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Unless directly assessing a time-constrained skill, which is rarely the case, consider giving students plenty of time to complete the assessment. Encouraging a shift from time-pressure assessments, which are anxiety-inducing, allows focusing more on evaluating the concepts and skills that students have learned.</p>

<h1>Learning from your students</h1>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of higher education, the ability to learn from students and adapt teaching methods accordingly is crucial for effective instruction, particularly in challenging subjects like statistics.</p>  

<p>Statistics anxiety is a common issue among students, and often originates from diverse backgrounds, varying levels of prior knowledge, and the inherent complexity of the subject matter. To address this challenge and enhance the learning experience, instructors should adopt a proactive and collaborative approach to gathering and utilising student feedback.</p> 

 
<p>The importance of continuous feedback cannot be overstated. Rather than only relying on end-of-semester evaluations, instructors should implement regular feedback mechanisms throughout the course. This ongoing dialogue between students and instructors serves multiple purposes:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 1em;margin-bottom: .5em">
<li>It allows for timely adjustments to course materials and teaching methods.</li> 
<li>It helps instructors evaluate and improve their teaching effectiveness.</li>
<li>It fosters a collaborative and responsive learning environment.</li>
<li>It empowers students to actively shape their educational experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>By creating an open and receptive atmosphere for feedback, instructors demonstrate their commitment to student success and continuous improvement. This approach not only addresses immediate concerns but also contributes to the long-term refinement of the course for future cohorts. Moreover, the process of seeking and responding to feedback can significantly improve student engagement. When students see that their input is valued and leads to tangible changes, they are more likely to engage with their learning and feel a sense of ownership over their education. This increased engagement can, in turn, help alleviate statistics anxiety and improve overall learning outcomes.</p> 


<button type="button" class="collapsible6">6.1 Implement regular feedback mechanisms throughout the semester</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Collecting regular student feedback allows instructors to timely adjust course materials and teaching methods, rather than relying solely on end-of-semester evaluations. Student feedback can provide invaluable insights into what they find challenging and what is working well. Remember there are varied forms of feedback beyond explicit feedback questionnaires. For instance, quizzes that ask students about their confidence in a various methodologies can benefit both students as a reflection point (see "setting up your students for success") and instructors as a means of identifying areas for course improvement.

<button type="button" class="collapsible6">6.2 Offer diverse channels for feedback (e.g., surveys, office hours, forums)</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>
    Different students may feel more comfortable with various feedback methods. Providing students with a variety of platform/opportunities for feedback ensures that a wider range of perspectives are captured and considered. Only implementing feedback received during office hours doesnâ€™t capture, for example, the suggestions of more shy students. Useful tools include: reflective surveys, non-graded questions in regular course quizzes, anonymous discussion forums, or live-voting platforms during lectures (e.g., Padlet, TopHat, Mentimeter, Wooclap, Slido).

<button type="button" class="collapsible6">6.3 Openly respond to student feedback</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Demonstrating that student feedback leads to tangible changes encourages ongoing participation in the feedback process and shows that their opinions are valued. We recommend sharing with your students any changes that you have done or will do based on their suggestions, for example in a document on your course webpage or at the end of your lecture. If some changes cannot be implemented, clearly communicate the rationale to students so that they know they are not being ignored.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible6">6.4 Ensure there is statistics representation in Staff-Student forums/committees</button>
<div class="ccontent">
  <p>Due to the difficulty of the subject matter, statistics should be a recurring item on the agenda of any staff-student meetings in your department or school. If such meetings are not schedule, consider suggesting one per semester to your head of department or teaching director.
